# ChickenInvaders_cpp

I've developed this project for a high school certificate and, as it can be observed, the code is not the cleanest. In order to achieve this project I've used the C++ SFML library https://www.sfml-dev.org/ and had the tutorial here https://youtu.be/rWaSo2usU4A as the foundation for the project.

INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Opens in release with "GAME.exe";
2) Use the arrows to move around and avoid hitting the chickens;
3) Use space in order to shoot lasers and score points if they destroy the evil chickens 
4) Every 50 points you get a bonus life if and only if you haven't stacked the maximum number of lives already;

P.S.: No chickens were hurt during the development of this game
